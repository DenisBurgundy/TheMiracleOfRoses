# TheMiracleOfRoses

A miracle of the roses is a miracle in which roses manifest an activity of God or of a saint. Such a miracle is presented in various hagiographies and legends in different forms, and it occurs in connection with diverse individuals such as Saints Elizabeth of Hungary (1207–1231), Elizabeth of Portugal (1271–1336), St. Dorothy, a 4th-century virgin martyr at Caesarea in Cappadocia (died ca. 311), and Our Lady of Guadalupe (appeared in 1531).
This symbolism attained a deeper complexity when contrasted with the rose's thorns. This contrast inspired the Christian Latin poet Coelius Sedulius, who wrote a very elaborate comparison between Eve, our first mother, and Mary, the Mother of Jesus our Savior. The rose was a privileged symbol for Mary, Queen of heaven and earth. It became a symbol in religious writing and iconography in different images and settings, to invoke a variety of intellectual and emotional responses.
